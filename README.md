**Analyst take-home assignment**

**Carl Stimson - January 17, 2021**

As requested, this contains a Flask app for entering and viewing data on pets and a notebook analyzing a dataset.

* `requirements.txt` contains everything needed for both the app and notebook. However, to run the part-of-speech section in the notebook, the Spacy model may need to be downloaded separately (use: `-m spacy download en_core_web_sm`).

* Pytest needs to be run from the base directory (`analyst-takehome`) using this terminal command: `python -m pytest`.

* `takehome_CLEANED.csv` is the original dataset plus several columns created during the text-processing steps in the notebook. 

Please let me know if I can provide anything else!
